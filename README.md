# What's this

nginx configurations for the SSE website. The configuration is forked and slightly modified from [perusio/drupal-with-nginx](https://github.com/perusio/drupal-with-nginx). See that project repository for more details.

```bash
sudo apt-get install nginx-extras
sudo mv /etc/nginx /etc/nginx_backup
sudo git clone https://github.com/TJUSSE/sseweb-nginx-config /etc/nginx
```
